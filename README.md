### Good Afternoon! ðŸ‘‹
Its always afternoon somewhere... 


ðŸ˜„  I am a recent graduate of a 14 week Java training course in which I have learned the skill of a Java Developer and the skills of a Java SDET.

ðŸŒ±  Recently I've just been hired on my first consultant job as a Java SDET for Deloitte!

ðŸ“«  I've got a passion for technology and an insatioable drive to get involved in new things. (You can call me a bit of a technological daredevil). My interests have been based in problem solving since I was a child watching cartoons and admiring the villains tech.

ðŸ¤”  Currently I am refactoring some of my recent projects. Fixing up errors, correcting my coding terminology, rewriting more efficient code... all the good stuff. I'm doing all this while I wait to start at my first contracted job!

ðŸ”­  I have also learned Spring Boot MVC, git version control, Behaviour driven development, Creating test frameworks, Using Selenium for automation testing and much much more.

ðŸ’¬  I also have had plenty of experience in my university days learning python and C++. 

ðŸ˜„  Ask me about OOP, SOLID, AGILE or anything about the projects I've done!
